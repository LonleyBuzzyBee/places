## Description

A website created with C# and HTML where a user can submit a word and determine its raw Scrabble score.


### Specs
* _the form has to be able to take the input javascript object places and descriptor objects within them, i.e; location, landmark, notes_
* _the form then has to take that inputed 'place' and pass it through the function, and define it as the javascript object places._
* _once the object has been defined, the form has to output different characteristics that have been assigned, for that inputted object place._
